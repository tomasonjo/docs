## What is an Agent Builder run?

An Agent Builder run is a single execution (a complete invocation) of an agent. Runs occur when you create, test, or run an agent. An Agent Builder run includes any message delivered to the agent through configured triggers (including third-party integrations or other connected services) as well as messages sent directly through the Agent Builder user interface (e.g., via the chat interface). An interrupt for human-in-the-loop creates a separate Agent Builder run when resuming. An execution failure does not count as an Agent Builder run.

## Are model costs included with Agent Builder pricing?

No. Model usage is billed separately by your model provider. Agent Builder lets you choose the model you want (for example, Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, or another provider) and connect it using your provider API key. For more information on configuring models, see the [Agent Builder setup](/langsmith/agent-builder-setup#required-model-key) page.

## Are agent tools included with Agent Builder pricing?

Agent Builder includes built-in tools and supports connecting third-party tools via a remote MCP server. Third-party tools typically require you to authenticate with your account, and any fees or usage charges are billed by the third-party provider. For more information on setting up tool keys, see the [Agent Builder setup](/langsmith/agent-builder-setup#optional-tool-keys) page.

## Are Agent Builder runs automatically traced in LangSmith, and do they count toward billing?

Yes. Every Agent Builder run is automatically traced in LangSmith. These traces are attributed to the user's account and count toward usage-based billing under the customer's LangSmith plan.
