Agent Builder includes starter templates to help you create agents quickly. Templates preconfigure system prompts, common tools, and optional triggers for popular use cases. You can use a template as a baseline and customize everything.

## How to use templates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick a template">
    In Agent Builder, choose a template that matches your use case (for example, email summarization, Slack digests, or CRM follow‑ups).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review tools and prompts">
    Each template comes with an initial system prompt and a set of tools. Adjust the prompt to your tone and workflow, and enable or disable tools as needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add triggers (optional)">
    For scheduled or event‑driven behavior, add a cron schedule or connect a trigger (for example, Slack or Gmail).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and iterate">
    Run the agent, review outputs, and refine prompts or tools. You can add sub‑agents for more complex tasks.
  </Step>
</Steps>
