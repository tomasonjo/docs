# API Reference Documentation

These are auto-generated API reference files. **Do NOT apply the standard documentation guidelines to these files.**

## Important

- Do not modify these files manually - they are generated from source code
- Do not apply custom formatting rules from `copilot-instructions.md`
- Do not suggest changes to structure, style, or content
- Do not add frontmatter or reformat existing content
- Do not apply the style guide or content strategy from the main instructions

## What you CAN do

- Fix broken links if they point to incorrect URLs
- Report issues with the generation process
- Suggest improvements to the source code that generates these files

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter errors like "could not collect package XYZ", ensure the mkdocstrings syntax used has underscores for package names (e.g., `langchain_ollama` instead of `langchain-ollama`). This applies to the `.md` files used to generate these references.
