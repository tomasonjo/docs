Agent Builder supports two visibility modes:

- Private agents: private to the creator. Useful for personal workflows and experiments.
- Workspace agents: shared within the workspace. Good for team workflows, or agents you want to share with others.

## Differences

- Ownership and access: private agents are only visible to you; workspace agents are visible to anyone else within the same LangSmith workspace.
- Tool Authentication:
    - **OAuth**: Both modes support OAuth and secret-based tools. OAuth credentials are always scoped to a user, so workspace agents can not share OAuth tokens, and new users cloning workspace agents must re-authenticate with the selected tools.
    - **Secrets**: Since secrets are scoped to a workspace, workspace agents & private agents will both use the same LangSmith secret.

## What's public vs. private

### Threads/chat history

Threads are always user scoped, so even if an agent is workspace scoped, the chat history created within that agent will always be private, and only accessible to the specific user who created them.

### System prompt, tools, sub-agents

The system prompt, selected tools, and sub-agents will be public on workspace scoped agents. Users will not be able to modify these fields on the original workspace scoped agent, but can make changes once they've cloned the agent.

### Triggers

The trigger type on workspace scoped agents is public (e.g., Slack message received), but the specific connection with the trigger (e.g. the Slack channel, or Gmail address) is not shared. This way, users know what trigger to use when cloning an agent, but can't gain unauthorized access to any connections the original user has set up.
