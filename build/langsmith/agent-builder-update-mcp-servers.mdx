<Warning>
Changing the URL of a custom MCP server will break any agents that use tools from that server.
</Warning>

Agent Builder stores tool references by MCP server URL. If you update the URL of a custom MCP server, existing agents will fail when attempting to call those tools because the stored URL no longer matches.

## How to update an MCP server URL

1. Update your MCP server URL in the workspace settings
2. For each agent using tools from that server:
   - Remove the affected tools from the agent configuration
   - Re-add the tools (they will now reference the new URL)
3. Test the agent to confirm tools work correctly
