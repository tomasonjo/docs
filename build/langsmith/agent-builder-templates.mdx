Agent Builder includes starter templates to help you create agents quickly. Templates include predefined system prompts, tools, and triggers (if applicable) for common use cases. You can use templates as-is, or as a baseline to customize.

## How to use templates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick a template" icon="squares-plus">
    In Agent Builder, choose a template that matches your use case (e.g., Gmail assistant, Linear Slack bot, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review tools and prompts" icon="sliders">
    Each template comes with an initial system prompt and a set of tools. Review the tools and prompt to ensure they align with your needs (you can always edit them later, or have the agent edit it for you).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone and authenticate" icon="key">
    Click `Clone Template` in the top right to start the cloning process. If you haven't already authenticated with OAuth for the tools in the template, you'll be prompted to do so.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add triggers (optional)" icon="clock">
    If a template includes a trigger, you'll be prompted to:
    - Authenticate and setup the trigger if you haven't done this before
    or
    - Select an existing trigger from the dropdown list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and iterate" icon="rocket">
    Run the agent, review outputs, and refine prompts or tools. To edit your cloned agent, either make the changes manually, or ask the agent to make the changes for you!
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Templates are starting points. You can customize prompts, add or remove tools, attach triggers, and switch models at any time.
